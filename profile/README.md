# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

This repository contains all the code concerning the gosub-browser. It's not mature, or even remotely capable of displaying html pages for you, but it might be some day. 


## Current status

Right now the focus is to get a html5 tokenizer and parser up and running. This would allow us to send the parser a HTML document (or fetch it directly from the internet), and 
it will output a document-tree of tokens that make up given webpage. That's it. It is not much, but still a very important part of the system. From that point, we can either do 
some work on fetching these html pages remotely, or see if we can convert this document-tree to a DOM tree, which would be the input for other systems like the user-agent that 
actually can render the tree onto the screen.


# 🌈 Contribution guidelines 
**how can the community get involved?**

There will be a guideline.


# 👩‍💻 Useful resources
**where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?**

We don't have a lot of resources. Hopefully we will have a wiki or something that holds documentation about the browser.
